                <h2>What is an Endockscope?</h2>
                <p>The Endockscope is a specialized system that allows for the coupling of a smartphone to an endoscopic device. The Endockscope system consists of an adapter that allows for the attachment of a smartphone to the eyepiece of an endoscope and a LED light source. This small, compact system replaces the traditional, bulky endoscopic tower that includes a separate monitor, video box, light source, wires, and camera. By utilizing the benefits of mobile technology, the Endockscope provides a low cost, compact alternative to traditional endoscopy for research and educational purposes.</p>
                <p>The Endockscope was recently featured in an interview with Metagadget. It has also previously been presented at the 2013 World Congress of Endourology in New Orleans and the 2014 AUA annual meeting in Orlando where it received the First prize Audio-Visual Award.</p>
